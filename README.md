Executive Summary
The project builds many conference trail rest stations. The design provides a rest stop for passing
passengers based on the customer's feedback and project requirements. These designs will be
processed inside the customer's Own boundaries, including different weather, cultural, and
environmental locations. Customers, travelers, PEI government, University of Toronto School of
Engineering, Forest Service, and others affected the project. They limit the project's
implementation at any time.
The initiative stores mass by offering areas to rest, eat, mingle, and spend time. The project
promotes social interaction, renewable energy, reliability and long-term goals, plentiful natural
illumination, and local culture and community awareness. As the team designs, these basic
objectives will be expanded and maybe supplemented.
S1: The cabin-like design is octagonal with wide windows for natural illumination. The
interactive wall, fireplace, and balcony promote social interaction and sustainability while
meeting all project goals, restrictions, and functions.
S2: The one-story rest room has an all-gender lavatory, greywater harvesting, PIR-controlled
LED lights, and a PedalCell charging station. It has stunning views of the Midgell River and
environs. The open interior design includes an interactive Confederation Trail map, hanging
monkey bars for kids, and chairs. Premium materials and a buoyant floating mechanism protect
the construction from floods and high tides.
S3:The Pavilion combines modern aesthetics and art with outdoor natural flair. The design meets
users' fundamental necessities while letting them relax and impress passengers.
Out of the three alternate designs, the Octogono Resting Spot was chosen as the main design
with the help of Pugh method
The proposed dates for testing the measures of success are March 30th - April 1st for solar
panels installation and material prototyping; Then note water level and and Tank prototype along
with a miniature prototype.
